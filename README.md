# EECS598-008 Deep Learning for Computer Vision Winter 2022

This course was offered by Prof. Justin Johnson at University of Michigan to talk really deep about computer vision especially in deep learning. Find course notes and assignments [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/).

### Assignment 1:
Q1: PyTorch 101.

Q2: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier.

### Assignment 2:
Q1: Linear Classifiers.

Q2: Two-layer Neural Network.

Q3: MNIST Challenge.

### Assignment 3:
Q1: Fully-Connected Neural Network.

Q2: Convolutional Neural Network.

### Assignment 4:
Q1: One-Stage Detector: FCOS: Fully-Convolutional One-Stage Object Detector (Tian et al, CVPR 2019).

Q2: Two-layer Neural Network: walk through the implementation of a two-stage object detector similar to Faster R-CNN (Ren et al, NeurIPS 2015). This will combine a fully-convolutional Region Proposal Network (RPN) and a second-stage recognition network.

### Assignment 5:
Q1: Image Captioning with Recurrent Neural Networks.

Q2: Transformer model for simple arithmetic operations.
